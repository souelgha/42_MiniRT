# This project is an introduction to the beautiful world of Raytracing.

miniRT is the first ray tracer coded in C and normed.

## What is raytracing ?
Raytracing is a powerful technique in computer graphics used to generate realistic images by simulating how light interacts with objects in a scene. Instead of just putting shapes on a screen, it acts like virtual light.

## What you need to succeed:
- Familiarity with C programming.
- Fundamentals of Linear Algebra (vector definition and operations).
- Fundamental Trigonometry (cosine, tangent, arctangent).
- Computer Graphics Basics (usage of miniLibX library).
- Geometry (sphere, plane, cylinder equations).

## build and start
run 
``` bash
make
```
then you can run the program
``` bash
./minirt <file.rt>
```
